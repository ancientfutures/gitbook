# Laravel

### Get Started

Before creating your first Laravel project, you should ensure that your local machine has PHP and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed. If you are developing on macOS, PHP and Composer can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). In addition, we recommend [installing Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/).

### [Getting Started On macOS](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x#getting-started-on-macos) <a href="#getting-started-on-macos" id="getting-started-on-macos"></a>

If you're developing on a Mac and [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) is already installed, you can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project. For example, to create a new Laravel application in a directory named "example-app", you may run the following command in your terminal:

```
curl -s "https://laravel.build/example-app" | bash
```
